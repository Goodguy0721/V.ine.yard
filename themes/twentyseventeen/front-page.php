			<h2>EST.&nbsp;2009</h2>
			<p>At <em>Lightfoot &amp; Wolfville</em> Vineyards we grow <em>handcrafted</em>, small-lot wines in <em>certified organic</em> vineyards.</p>
			<p>Our focus on classic vinifera includes <em>Chardonnay</em>, <em>Pinot Noir</em>, <em>Riesling</em>, and other German-styled whites specifically selected for our microclimates.</p>
			<p>We’re maximizing the expression of our wines by practicing biodynamic viticulture in some of the <em>Annapolis Valley’s</em> most privileged vineyard sites. Our intention from the beginning has been an unwavering dedication to quality throughout the wine’s journey.</p>
			<p>Lightfoot &amp; Wolfville’s new retail facility will be opening to the public in 2017.</p>

			<h1>A message from <em>Peter Gamble</em></h1>

			<p>One indisputable truth that every generation of winemakers learns and relearns, is that the finest wines come from the finest vineyards, grown and nurtured by farmers and viticulturists respectful of the land’s particular gifts and energies. Great wine is grown. So for the best stewards of those sites, we use the term “winegrowers” &mdash; just as we do for great artisan winemakers with deeply intuitive ties to their vines and their best soils.</p>
			<p>For over five years now, I have worked with the Lightfoot team &mdash; first as new viticulturists, and then as an emergent winery &mdash; and I can confidently say that they are winegrowers. And, moreover, they are advancing viticulture in the province: not only are they growing the classic champagne varieties to produce top-flight traditional sparklings, they are poised to forever change the face of classic Burgundian- and Germanic-influenced wines, as well.</p>
			<p>As all of this unfolds, this website will allow wine lovers in Canada to keep a close ear to the ground.</p>

			<h1>Wolfville Soil</h1>
			<div class="columns">
				<p>We have 35+ acres of vines on two sites, one on the edge of Wolfville and the other in nearby Avonport. Both vineyards have breathtaking views of Cape Blomidon, and benefit from the Minas Basin's moderating impact on climate.
				<p>Another shared aspect of the terroir at both sites is the rare Wolfville Formation Soil that makes up a mere 3 percent of our province's soil spectrum. The upper root horizon consists of glacial till with coarse sandy loam, while the deep root horizon’s clay content provides ideal moisture retention.</p>
				<p>We believe being present on our land means recognizing the living memory of its past inhabitants while keeping in tune, daily, with the life of our soil and vines. Our main estate has been in Michael’s family for generations – working the land is in our blood. We’ve also found evidence of earlier history on both our sites, including Acadian and Planter artifacts and even an Acadian-era house foundation where our current winemaking facility stands.</p>

		<h1>The Name</h1>
		<p>A light touch &amp; enlightened approach.</p>

		<article>
			<div class="columns">
				<p>The Lightfoot name goes back eight generations in Wolfville. Originating in northern England, it referred to the swift-footedness of our forebears who traditionally worked as messengers. At Lightfoot &amp; Wolfville we like to think we bring a light touch and enlightened approach to both the agricultural and artisanal parts of our work – letting the land offer up its innate best, without subjecting it to aggressive inputs; letting our wines benefit from classic winemaking methods, emphasizing gentle gravity production and natural wild-yeast fermentations.</p>

			<h1>Wine Growing</h1>
			<div class="columns">
				<p>The selection of our varietals at Lightfoot &amp; Wolfville has been made with close attention to each specific vineyard – their soil makeup, direct ocean influence, elevated hillside locations, and our growing understanding, season by season, of what makes them produce the best wines.</p>
				<p>Certified organic and grown according to the principles of biodynamic agriculture, our wines include classic Burgundian-inspired Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, Rieslings and other German-styled white wines, as well as traditional method prestige cuvée sparkling wines. Ours is the most diverse portfolio of classic European vinifera in Atlantic Canada.</p>
				<p>For us, wine growing is also a long-term opportunity to indulge, close-up, our fascination with the wonderful complexity of the natural world. Likewise, our winemaking is about a return from modern, large-scale methods to classic, hands-on viticulture and oenology: 100 percent hand-harvesting, traditional basket press production, indigenous wild yeast fermentations, and fine French oak barriques for aging.</p>
